\arguments{
\item{X}{covariates.}

\item{Y}{the observed outcome vector.}

\item{T}{the vector of treatment assignments.}

\item{alpha}{the target confidence level.}

\item{null_type}{the null to be tested that takes value in \{"sharp", "negative", "positive"\}. See Details.}

\item{score_type}{the type of nonconformity scores. The default is "cqr".}

\item{ps_fun}{a function that models the treatment assignment mechanism. The default is "regression_forest".}

\item{ps}{a vector of propensity score. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{pred_fun}{a function that models the potential outcome conditional on the covariates. The default is "quantile_forest".}

\item{train_prop}{proportion of units used for training. The default is 75\\%.}

\item{train_id}{The index of the units used for training. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\value{
an \code{itemgn} object.

\description{
\code{cfsens_mgn} conducts sensitivity analysis of individual treatment effects
with the marginal guarantee.
It currently supports testing the sharp null and the directional nulls.
}
\details{
When \code{null_type = "sharp"}, the null hypothesis is H_0: Y(1) - Y(0) = 0.
When \code{null_type = "negative"}, the null hypothesis is H_0: Y(1) - Y(0) <= 0.
When \code{null_type = "positive"}, the null hypothesis is H_0: Y(1) - Y(0) >= 0.
